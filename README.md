As part of the Power BI certification course offered on Udemy by the Maven Analytics team, I undertook a project with the goal of honing my skills with Microsoft Power BI. This project involved creating a comprehensive dashboard for a company specializing in the sale of bicycles and bicycle accessories.

The project encompasses the development of four distinct dashboards:

1. **Executive Dashboard:** Strategically designed for executive-level stakeholders, providing a high-level overview of crucial performance indicators.

2. **Map Dashboard:** Offers a geospatial perspective, visualizing key geographical information relevant to the business.

3. **Product Detail Dashboard:** Delivers in-depth insights into product specifics, offering detailed information crucial for strategic decision-making.

4. **Customer Detail Dashboard:** Houses a wealth of customer information, facilitating customer-centric analysis and decision-making.

Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, total profit, total orders, and total return from Adventure Works product sales were instrumental in gauging project success.

The project unfolded through three main stages:

1. **Connecting and Shaping Data:** Involving the importation and transformation of data to suit project requirements.

2. **Creating Calculated Fields and DAX Measures:** Utilizing Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to formulate calculated fields and measures for robust data analysis.

3. **Visualizing Data with Reports:** Employing Power BI's visualization capabilities to create insightful and engaging reports.

Special thanks to my instructors, Chris Dutton, Aaron Parry, and the entire Maven Analytics team, whose guidance played a pivotal role in shaping this project.
